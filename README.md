# multivac

Turns your command line into a fictional supercomputer

## Installation

```bash
make && sudo make install
```

## Usage

To pose a question to Multivac:

```
can entropy be reversed
```

To simulate the end of the universe:

```
sudo can entropy be reversed
```

## Explanation

This is a reference to Multivac as described in Isaac Asimov's The Last Question.

Also, this idea was shamelessly stolen from the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3h8qld/can_entropy_be_reversed/) with a few improvements added:

* Multivac gives one of 4 random responses regarding insufficient data
* sudo-ing forces Multivac to give his final answer to the last question
